# Linear-Modelling-Friends-Sitcom

Im a big fan of the TV-Show 'Friends', I wanted to discover why it was a massive success, and I deemed to nessaccery to test out some of the skills I had aquired from Statistics 2B and 'linear models with R - Julian Faraway'. Hence, this cute non-academic project :)

The Data I used for the project can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rezaghari/friends-series-dataset
